## App Description

All points from 9/20 to 20/20 are implemented.

Due to the requirement of only using whole numbers, the decimal places are cut
off.

The maximum in and output digits are 6. So the max resulting numbers are
999999. If the calculated output is higher than 999999, the number 999999 will
be displayed.

Apart from that, there are no known limitations.

In making this submission I confirm that I worked on this project individually
and that all the code was written by me. I did not use any frameworks to
generate code nor copy code (except from CS317 web). A copy of the code has been
pushed to the assessment GitLab.
